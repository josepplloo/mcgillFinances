Making a purchase today is great for present you, but the money you spent is no longer available for future you. Not making the purchase today may be unfortunate for present you, but future you will enjoy the flexibility of having access to those funds.

2-1 Budgeting is about aiming for solid financial positioning in both the short and long term – keeping in mind the priorities of “present you” and the needs of “future you”.

2-2 Your budget will be an account of your income and expenditures over a specific period of time, allowing you to see where you stand financially.

2-3 In fact, it is estimated that only about 50% of Canadians have budgets, so if you don’t have one, you are not alone. Having a budget is recommended to ensure that you stay on track with your spending and savings goals.

2-4 One of the first things that most financial experts recommend doing after building your budget is to establish an emergency fund. An emergency fund is an amount of money that you put aside in secure place, like a high-interest savings account, that can cover your living expenses for three to six months. This way, if anything unexpected arises, your basic needs can be taken care of in the short term.

2-5 Income minus expenses equals savings. A surplus occurs when income is higher than expenses, and a deficit occurs when income is lower than expenses.

2-6 When your expenditures are higher than your income, that is a deficit. A surplus occurs when your income is higher than your expenditures and represents the money you should theoretically have left over at the end of the selected period. This can then be allocated toward your short-, medium- and long-term goals.

2-7 There are many free resources and templates available, both online and offline. Don’t be afraid to do a quick search – it might make your budgeting task much easier!

2-8 Asking yourself tough questions about the changes you can make financially could help you save significantly more of your after-tax income. Having self-discipline over your wants is one of the hardest but most essential aspects of managing a budget. Don’t worry if, at first, you can only find small things to save on. It would be fantastic to start saving hundreds of dollars per week, but getting that done may take time. Even small changes add up and can make a significant difference in the long term. Take one step at a time, and make sure to celebrate your successes along the way!

2-8 After building your budget, your projected monthly savings are $250. If your goal is to save $5,000, how long should it take to achieve your goal?
$5,000 / $250 = 20 months or 1.67 years.
